Automatic watering system for plants - Code i've used when making the system

- File description -

# 01 Smart Systems - Bluetooth Controller:
  - This is the code i used to test if the castor wheels and the gear motors was functioning as intended.
  - I used BT here to make it easier before moving onwards with the line following sensors.
  
# 02 Smart Systems - Line Follower Sensor:
  - Testing if i got the line follower sensors to work together with the gear motors.
  
# 03 Smart Systems - Ultrasonic Sensor and Line Follower Sensor Test:
  - Got the ultrasonic sensor working together with the line follower sensor.
  
# 04 Smart Systems - Crane Test:
  - Testing the operation of the crane by using servo motor.
 
# 05 Smart Systems - Soil Moisture Sensor and Crane Test:
  - Testing soil moisture sensor together with the crane (servo motor).
  
# 06 Smart Systems - Gear Motor Test With Bluetooth:
  - Was at the start of the project and did this together with #1.

# 07 Smart Systems - Power Savings Test:
  - Testing to see if i could implement a power savings function to the system.
  
# 08 Smart Systems - Servo Motor Test:
  - Testing how the servo motor functions.

# 09 Smart Systems - Soil Moisture Sensor Test:
  - Testing what kind of values i would recieve with the sensor.
  
# 10 Smart Sytems - Water Pump Test:
  - Testing to see how the water pump operates.
  
# 11 Smart Systems - System Test:
  - Test of all components together.

# 12 Smart Systems - Final Prototype Iteration 01:
  - First complete system test. I started by adding some basic funtionality and added more and more functionality through several iterations.

# 13 Smart Systems - Final Prototype Iteration 02:
  - Added more functionality.

# 14 Smart Systems - Final Prototype Iteration 03:
  - Added more functionality.
  
# 15 Smart Systems - Final Prototype Iteration 04:
  - Added more functionality.
  
# 16 Smart Systems - Final Prototype Iteration 05:
  - Added more functionality.
  
# 17 Smart Systems - Final Prototype Completed
  - Done with the programming, and this is the code that have been used during the final tests and recordings.
